This example demonstrates a subtle off-by-one error that can occur in Ada for loops due to the combination of early loop termination and array indexing.  The issue arises when the loop exits prematurely, potentially leading to an incorrect result. This repository provides both the buggy code and a corrected version.  The focus is on the nuances of Ada's loop control and how to avoid these common pitfalls.
